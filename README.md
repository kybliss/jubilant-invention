This is an HTML multiple choice quiz. Upon clicking the button, it clears the homepage text and asks the user a question. When the user has clicked one of the four buttons, it moves through to the next question, and continues to do so until the quiz has been complete. When the user has completed the quiz, it displays their final score. There are four questions in total.

I sampled source code from a tutorial found on Geeksforgeeks.org (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-simple-javascript-quiz/#), and wrote a modified version of it with the guidance of a AskBCS Learning Assistant.
